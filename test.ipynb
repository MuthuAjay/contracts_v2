The Supplier shall ensure that: the Goods are properly packed and secured in such manner as to enable them to reach their destination in good condition and in accordance with the Documents and Specifications; each delivery of Goods is accompanied by a delivery note which shows the order number, the type and quantity of Goods (including the code number of the Goods, where applicable), special storage instructions (if any) and, if the relevant Order is being delivered by instalments, the outstanding balance of Goods remaining to be delivered; and if the Supplier requires us to return any packaging material to the Supplier, that fact is to be clearly stated on the delivery note.

The Supplier shall deliver the Goods specified in each Order: on or before the Delivery Date; at the delivery location as instructed by us (\\u201cDelivery Location\\u201d); and during our normal business hours, or as instructed by us. Delivery of Goods is completed on the completion of unloading of those Goods at the Delivery Location on the Delivery Date. If the Supplier delivers more or less than the quantity of Goods ordered, and we accept the delivery, a pro rata adjustment shall be made to the invoice for the Goods. If the Supplier: delivers less than 50% of the quantity of Goods ordered, we may reject the Goods; and delivers more than 105% of the quantity of Goods ordered, we may at our discretion reject the Goods or the excess Goods. If we reject any Goods they are returnable at the Supplier's Expense. If the Supplier fails to collect rejected Goods within a reasonable period after notification of the rejection, we may charge the Supplier storage costs and sell or dispose of the rejected Goods. We will account to the Supplier for the proceeds of sale (if any) after deducting the purchase price paid for the Goods, storage costs and its reasonable costs and expenses in connection with the sale. The Supplier shall not deliver Orders in instalments without our prior written consent. Where it is agreed that Orders may be delivered by instalments, such instalments shall be invoiced separately. However, failure by the Supplier to deliver any one instalment on time or at all, or any defect in an instalment, shall entitle us to use any of its remedies as set out in this Agreement. Continuing Obligation to Provide the Goods: The Supplier shall continue to perform all of its obligations under this Agreement and shall not suspend the provision of the Goods, notwithstanding: any withholding or deduction by us of any sum due to the Supplier pursuant to the exercise our right to such withholding or deduction under this Agreement; the existence of an unresolved dispute; and/or any failure by us to pay any Fees or Expenses, unless the Supplier is entitled to terminate this Agreement as a result of our failure to pay undisputed Fees. Inspection and Acceptance We shall at all times retain the right to inspect the Goods provided by the Supplier and shall have the right to review, require correction or additional follow up, if necessary, and accept the Goods or Service. We will notify the Supplier of its contact who shall be responsible for reviewing, inspecting and approving delivery of the Goods and Service.

Invoices must be submitted within sixty (60) days of the Delivery Date of the Goods. Advance payments will not be made unless specifically authorised in writing by the Accountant General. The Supplier's failure to timely submit a proper invoice as set forth in this Section may result in a delay in payment by us.  We shall not pay interest on any late payment to the Supplier resulting from the Supplier's failure to submit a proper or timely invoice or otherwise comply with the terms of this Section.  The Supplier agrees that we are not responsible, nor will we be liable to the Supplier under law or equity for any and all Expenses that the Supplier may incur resulting from any delays in payment caused by the Supplier\\u2019s failure to comply with the terms of this Section. Proper invoices remaining unpaid for more than sixty (60) days following the due date shall bear interest at the rate of 12% per annum.

      "    \"General\": \"This Master Service Agreement (\\u201cAgreement\\u201d) is entered into by Iowa State University of Science and Technology, on behalf of its <ISU UNIT NAME AND ADDRESS>, Ames, Iowa 50011 (\\u201cISU\\u201d), and <CUSTOMER NAME> (\\u201cCustomer\\u201d), <CUSTOMER ADDRESS>.  The effective date of this Agreement shall be the date on which the last party signs this Agreement (\\u201cEffective Date\\u201d). Scope and Performance of Services. Customer has expressed a need to use the services of ISU from time to time on various projects.  Customer and ISU shall enter into an Individual Project Agreement (\\u201cIPA\\u201d) for each project for which Customer desires ISU to provide services. The IPA shall be substantially in the form of Attachment A.  Each IPA shall be deemed part of and incorporated into this Agreement.  ISU shall perform the services described in the IPA (the \\u201cServices\\u201d).  Unless stated otherwise in the IPA, ISU shall provide any personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and supplies required for the Services to be completed.  ISU shall use reasonable efforts to perform the Services requested within the projected costs and time period indicated in the IPA.  In the event ISU\\u2019s costs exceed the projected price or in the event the Services cannot be performed within the time desired, ISU will notify Customer as soon as reasonably possible.  Customer shall have the option of terminating the IPA or continuing the Services for an additional cost or, if feasible, an extension of time. Customer Materials. If Customer is to furnish ISU with materials to be tested or used while performing the Services (\\u201cMaterials\\u201d), such Materials shall be identified in the IPA.  Customer shall provide ISU, at no charge, with a sufficient quantity of the Materials to perform the Services. Customer represents and warrants that it is authorized to retain ISU to perform the Services using the Materials.  Customer shall disclose in the IPA whether the Material is a hazardous substance and of any known hazards and risks associated with the Materials and whether the Material is an item on the Munitions List or the Commerce Control List other than EAR99 items.  ISU shall use the Materials only as needed to provide the Services and shall not modify, alter, reverse engineer or run analytic tests to determine the composition of the Materials without Customer\\u2019s prior written permission.  ISU shall not provide the Materials to a third party nor allow access to the Materials by a third party.  ISU may provide the Materials to its employees and students who have a bona fide need to use the Materials in performing the Services provided that ISU requires such employees or students to abide by the terms of this Agreement. Upon completion of the Services or at Customer\\u2019s request, ISU shall destroy or return to Customer the Materials not consumed during the performance of the Services in accordance with Customer\\u2019s instructions.  ISU may retain a sample of the Materials if needed to evidence its fulfillment of its contractual obligations.  Unless stated otherwise in the IPA, Customer shall assume all risk of loss for the transportation of the Materials to and from ISU and shall be responsible for all delivery costs. Customer retains ownership of the Materials at all times. Results. Customer shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all deliverables generated as part of the Services (\\u201cResults\\u201d), including any intellectual property rights in the Results. ISU may retain a copy of the Results to evidence its fulfillment of its contractual obligations pursuant to this Agreement.  ISU shall treat the Results as Confidential Information. No Warranty. The parties recognize the Results cannot be guaranteed even through use of ISU\\u2019s reasonable efforts.  Accordingly, the failure of ISU to achieve specific Results shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.  ISU DOES NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICES OR RESULTS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  ISU IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. Customer should determine independently whether the Results are suitable for the particular use intended by Customer. To the extent permitted by law, Customer shall indemnify and hold harmless ISU, the State of Iowa, and the Board of Regents \\u2013 State of Iowa and their respective officers, employees and students from any claims, damages, fines, losses or expenses incurred by any of them arising from or in connection with Customer\\u2019s use of the Results, including but not limited to Customer\\u2019s sale of a commercial product based upon the Results. Inventions. The parties do not anticipate that any potentially patentable discoveries will be first conceived and reduced to practice in ISU\\u2019s performance of the Services (\\u201cInventions\\u201d).  However, if while performing the Services ISU develops an Invention that incorporates or requires use of the Materials or Customer\\u2019s Confidential Information, ISU shall promptly notify Customer and all right, title and interest to such Invention shall vest solely and exclusively in Customer.  All right, title and interest to any Invention developed by ISU while providing the Services that does not incorporate or require use of the Materials or Confidential Information shall vest solely and exclusively in ISU (e.g., improvements in methodology, processes or equipment that do not incorporate Customer\\u2019s Materials or Confidential Information). The parties shall execute any assignments or other documents necessary to effect the foregoing. Confidential Information Definition. If a party shares information with the other party and desires for the recipient to treat such information as confidential, the provider shall identify it as such at the time of disclosure (\\u201cConfidential Information\\u201d).  Results shall be deemed Confidential Information without further need to identify it as such.  Confidential Information does not include information that:\\t(a) is or becomes generally known or available to the public without breach of this Agreement; (b) is known by the recipient at the time of disclosure, as shown by recipient\\u2019s written records; (c) is disclosed to the recipient by a third party who had no duty of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by recipient without use of the provider\\u2019s Confidential Information, as shown by recipient\\u2019s written records. Use and Disclosure. The recipient shall use Confidential Information only for the purpose of this Agreement.  The recipient shall hold Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose Confidential Information to any third party.  The recipient may disclose Confidential Information to its employees or students provided that the recipient requires such employees or students to abide by the terms of this Agreement. If a recipient is required by judicial or other governmental authority or by a subpoena or a public records request to disclose Confidential Information, the recipient shall promptly inform the provider in writing so that the provider may seek a protective order or take other appropriate measures.  Customer acknowledges and understands that ISU is a state entity subject to Iowa\\u2019s public records laws. Return or Destruction; Ownership; Survival. Upon the provider\\u2019s written request, the recipient shall destroy or return to the provider the Confidential Information.  The receiving party may retain a copy to evidence its fulfillment of its contractual obligations pursuant to this Agreement.  Unless stated otherwise in the IPA, Confidential Information remains the provider\\u2019s property. The parties\\u2019 obligations with respect to Confidential Information shall remain in effect for a period of five years from the date of termination of this Agreement. Publicity and Use of Name. The parties shall not use the name or trademarks of the other party or the name of any of its employees in any publicity or advertising, including endorsements, without the prior written consent of the other party.  The parties may use the name of the party and its employees for fulfilling any reporting obligations. Financial. In consideration for the Services, Customer shall pay ISU the fees set forth in the IPA.  ISU shall issue an invoice or invoices to Customer, and Customer shall pay such invoices within thirty days of receipt.  Checks should be made payable to Iowa State University of Science and Technology.  Customer shall submit the payments to ISU at the following address: Iowa State University Treasurer\\u2019s Office 1220 Beardshear Hall 515 Morrill Road Ames, IA 50011-2103 If payment is not received from Customer when due, ISU may terminate the IPA and this Agreement.  In addition, the full account balance may be accelerated.  To the extent permitted by law, ISU may also impose a late payment charge computed at a periodic monthly rate of 1% per month on the balance or an annual percentage rate of 12% when computed from the billing date.  The unpaid account may be referred for collection, and Customer shall pay all collection costs and reasonable attorney\\u2019s fees if ISU must take action to recover any past due amounts.  ISU reserves the right under Iowa Code \\u00a7421.17(27) to offset State of Iowa tax refunds, lottery winnings or vendor payments. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate three years after the Effective Date. Either party may earlier terminate an IPA or this Agreement by providing the other party written notification thirty days prior to the proposed termination date.  If the Agreement is terminated, all IPAs are also terminated.  In the event of termination, Customer shall pay ISU for Services provided and non-cancelable obligations incurred prior to the termination date and ISU shall provide Customer with Results completed as of the termination date for which payment has been received.  The foregoing shall be in addition to any other remedies to which the parties are entitled. Force Majeure. Neither party shall be deemed in breach of this Agreement or liable for damages if its performance of any obligation under this Agreement is prevented or delayed by causes beyond its reasonable control, such as acts or omissions of communications carriers, energy shortages or outages, strikes or labor disputes of other\\u2019s workforces, fires, floods, inclement weather, acts of God, war, terrorism, civil disturbances, or acts of civil or military authorities. Relationship of Parties. Customer and ISU are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement creates any partnership or joint venture. Customer warrants that the Services are not sought for the purposes of admitting the Results as evidence in litigation, and Customer shall not call any ISU employee as an expert witness as a result of the Services rendered under this Agreement. This Agreement is not exclusive; Customer reserves the right to select other contractors to provide services similar or identical to the Services, and ISU reserves the right to provide to other clients services similar or identical to the Services. Notices. Notices relating to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered by messenger or overnight carrier to the other party at the address set forth above or such other address as may be given in writing in accordance with this Section.  Notice shall be deemed effective upon receipt. Miscellaneous. This Agreement (including all IPAs) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, whether written, oral, or implied.  All terms and conditions in other instruments, including purchase orders issued by Customer, are void.  This Agreement shall not be modified without the written mutual consent of the parties.  The failure of either party to require performance of any term or condition of this Agreement by the other party shall not constitute a waiver to subsequently enforce such term or condition.  The invalidity or illegality of one or more provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions.  The parties\\u2019 rights and obligations in this Agreement that, by their nature, would continue beyond the termination of this Agreement shall survive such termination.  This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Customer represents and warrants that it is not a \\u201cforeign source\\u201d pursuant to Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, 20 USC 1011f.  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Iowa, without giving effect to its conflicts of law provisions, and any litigation or actions commenced in connection with this Agreement shall be instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Iowa. Counterparts; Authorization. This Agreement and the IPAs may be executed in any number of counterparts and delivered by electronic transmission in PDF format.

In the event of a conflict between the acceptance criteria and the Documents, the acceptance criteria shall prevail. The testing period shall commence on the first Business Day after you have informed us in writing that you have completed the System, Service or Deliverables required to be performed prior to testing and that the System or Service are ready for testing, and the testing period shall continue for a period of up to sixty (60) days. During the testing period, we may notify you in writing of any error or defect in the System so that you may make any required modifications or repairs.  If you so elect in writing, testing will cease until you resubmit for final Acceptance testing, at which time the testing period shall be reset to that of a first submission for testing. We shall notify you in writing of your final Acceptance or rejection of the System or Service, or any part thereof, within thirty (30) days after the end of the testing period, or as same may be extended by us.  If we reject the System, Service or any part thereof, we shall provide notice identifying the criteria for final Acceptance that the System or Service failed to meet.  Following such notice, you shall have thirty (30) days to (a) modify, repair, or replace the System, Service or any portion thereof, or (b) otherwise respond to our notice. If you modify, repair, or replace the System, Service or any portion thereof, the testing period shall re-commence consistent with the procedures set forth above in this section. In the event you fail to remedy the reason(s) for our rejection of the System, Service or any portion thereof, within thirty (30) days after our initial notice of rejection, we may elect, in writing, to either accept the System or Service as it then exists or to reject the System or Service and terminate the Agreement. If we elect to accept the System or Service as it then exists (partial acceptance), you shall continue to use your best efforts to remedy the items identified in the applicable notice of rejection. If, despite such continuing best efforts, you fail to remedy the issue(s) identified by us within a reasonable time as determined by us, then we shall be entitled upon our sole option, to a refund of the sums paid to you or to deduct from future sums due under the Agreement the value of the rejected portion of the System or Service as mutually determined by the parties. If the parties cannot agree upon such value, we shall have the right to reject the System or Service and to terminate the Agreement on the terms stated above in this paragraph.\",\n",

Accept the System subject to a reasonable abatement of the Fee to take account of the loss to us caused by the failure of the Service or any part thereof to conform to the requirements specified in the Acceptance Tests. The amount of such loss shall be agreed between the parties or, in default of agreement within fourteen (14) days of the notice issued by us under this appendix, as shall be determined by an expert appointed under the Agreement. Accept that part of the System, which has passed the Acceptance Tests, and reject that part of the System, which has failed the Acceptance Tests.  You shall then be entitled to a partial Certificate in respect of that part which has been accepted. Such partial rejection shall not constitute termination of the Agreement but you shall be liable to us for such compensation for the part of the Service rejected as may be agreed by the parties within 14 days of the notice issued by us under this appendix, or in default of agreement, as shall be determined by the expert appointed under this Agreement. Reject the System as not being in conformity with the Agreement and terminate the Agreement for default by you, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. APPENDIX 4 Training and Documents You shall provide training to a sufficient number of our personnel to secure the satisfactory operation of the System and to enable our personnel to be able to train other Users (\\u201cTrain the Trainer\\u201d). The training format will be for you to Train the Trainer in the use of the configured version of the System through a combination of documentation, in-person seminars, recorded video and various online methods as required by us.

Such engagements shall be subject to further agreements; the parties shall agree the implementation and operation of any remote diagnostic tools, which you may make available from time to time; provide a telephone help desk or on-line service to receive and log calls for assistance and provide an initial fault diagnosis and resolution service. The fault diagnosis and resolution service shall be provided by sufficient competent people for 24 hours per day, 7 days per week [or during working days between 0800 and 1800]; as soon as a defect which has a significant effect on the use of the System or Service is reported by us or you become aware of the defect, you shall promptly commence work on diagnosing the defect and providing a report detailing requirements and cost to fix the defect and continue to work diligently until a fix of the defect can be successfully implemented on any part of the System. Service levels for responding to reports of defects and fixing defects or faults will be provided as a separate document to this Appendix. All changes and corrections made by you shall be documented and revised Documents shall be supplied to us. You shall be responsible for delivering corrected programs or instructions to correct the defect so that the System can be restored to operational use with least possible delay. You may be required by us to provide on-site or other support for reinstallation and recovery of the System.

All corrections made by you shall be free from Viruses and shall execute and/or operate without further defect or impact on other parts of the System. Intellectual Property Rights in any correction, enhancement or modification, made to the System or any new tool or technique or know-how developed as a consequence of correcting a defect shall be the property of the Government except where the intellectual property is an inherent part of the System and is to be made available to other licensees of the System. You shall be responsible at your own Expense for the maintenance and support of any part of the System which is supplied prior to acceptance and is required for use by the Government or you, as part of the System. You shall correct any fault which may be caused by our act or omission in not using the System or a Service in accordance with the Documents and shall be entitled to charge us a reasonable fee at the rate set out in the Fee and payment schedule for such work. If any part of the System or Service is terminated due to your un-remedied default of the System or at your request, then you shall provide all Documents of the System and internal maintenance instructions to allow us to maintain the System itself or to allow us to engage a third party to carry out the maintenance of the System.

Contractor agrees to maintain, at Contractor’s sole expense, and provide proof of insurance meeting TWU’s Third Party Insurance Standards (www.twu.edu/media/documents/risk-management/TWU-Third-Party-Insurance-Standards.pdf). By requiring such minimum insurance, TWU shall not be deemed or construed to have assessed the risk that may be applicable to the Contractor.  Therefore, the Contractor shall assess its own risks and, if it deems appropriate, maintain higher limits and/or broader coverages. The Contractor is not relieved of any liability or obligations assumed or pursuant to the contract by reason of its failure to obtain or maintain insurance in sufficient amounts, duration, or types. The Contractor’s failure to comply with the requirements of this section shall be considered a breach of this Agreement. Proof of insurance coverage is to be forwarded to TWU Risk Management by email at risk@twu.edu.\\t \\nThe Contractor’s failure to comply with the requirements of this section shall be considered a breach of this Agreement.\\nProof of Insurance Coverage will be forwarded to: \\n\\tInsert University Contact Name (such as Department Contract Administrator) and complete address.\\n4.\\tUniversity Insurance. TWU is governed by the Texas Tort Claims Act, which sets forth certain limitations and restrictions on the types of liability and the types of insurance coverage that can be required of TWU. TWU represents to Contractor that it either has insurances policies in place or sufficient resources to self-insure for all claims for which it may be responsible under the Texas Tort Claims Act.  TWU further represents to Contractor that it either has workers’ compensation insurance in the amount required by Texas statute or is entitled to self-insure for workers compensation coverage under Texas law and has elected to do so. TWU does not provide insurance coverage or accept liability for the intentional or negligent acts or omissions of guests, invitees, and other persons not employed by TWU. \\n5.\\tSovereign Immunity. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a limitation or a waiver on any of the immunities or defenses to which TWU is entitled as an agency of the State of Texas.  TWU enters this Agreement only to the extent authorized by applicable law. Any provision of this Agreement that is not authorized by or is inconsistent with applicable Texas law, including the opinions of the state’s Attorney General, is invalid.\\n6.\\tContractor Indemnity. Contractor shall indemnify, defend and hold TWU, its Regents, officers, employees and agents harmless from any and all manner of suits, claims or demands (1) arising out of or relating to Contractor’s, its employees’, agents’ and subcontractors’ acts or omissions arising under the performance of this Agreement; (2) the negligence or willful misconduct of Contractor, its agents, employees or subcontractors; (3) Contractor’s breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation hereunder; and (4) the infringement of any third party proprietary rights with respect to goods or services supplied to TWU in connection with this Agreement (each of which is an “Indemnifying Act”). Contractor shall reimburse TWU for any and all costs, damages and expenses including reasonable attorney’s fees to which TWU may be subject as a result of the occurrence of any Indemnifying Act. This provision shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and the indemnities described in this paragraph will not be subject to any liability caps stated anywhere in the Agreement.\\n7.\\tTaxes. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to supersede the laws of the United States or the State of Texas that accord the State of Texas, Agency, and all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the State of Texas exemptions from the payment(s) of all taxes of whatever kind. More specifically, to the extent permitted by applicable law, TWU shall not directly or indirectly be liable for taxes of any kind. TWU shall provide all applicable tax exemption certificates upon Contractor’s request.\\n8.\\tInsolvency. In the event of any proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency by or against Contractor, or in the event of appointment (with or without Contractor’s consent) of an assignee for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver, TWU may terminate this Agreement without prior notice and without incurring any liability whatsoever to Contractor.\\n9.\\tSubject to Appropriation. The parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement will be interpreted to create a future obligation or liability in excess of the funds currently appropriated to the Agency.\\n10.\\tTexas Risk and Authorization Management (“TX-RAMP”) for Cloud-Based Software Services. The parties hereby agree that if under this Agreement Contractor provides a cloud-based software offering which meets the criteria specified under the TX-RAMP Program (the “Subject Cloud Software”), the Subject Cloud Software is required to be TX-RAMP certified (which can be satisfied by specific product TX-RAMP certification, STATE-RAMP, FED-RAMP certification or another certification process approved by the State of Texas). Contractor must therefore comply with TX-RAMP, which is a standardized approach for security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring of cloud computing services that processes the data of a Texas state agency. Texas Government Code § 2054.0593 mandates that TWU must only enter or renew contracts to receive cloud computing services that comply with TX-RAMP requirements beginning January 1, 2022. Contractor hereby warrants that the Subject Cloud Software has received, and Contractor will maintain, the approvals required by TX-RAMP. TWU may immediately terminate this Agreement without penalty if Contractor’s certification herein is inaccurate or becomes inaccurate. The parties agree that additional cloud-based services or products may not be added under this Agreement, unless such additional cloud-based services or products are also approved as required by TX-RAMP. For avoidance of doubt, if no Subject Cloud Software is being provided under this Agreement, this paragraph is not applicable.\\n11.\\tCompliance with Specifications. Contractor warrants that all goods, services, or work supplied to TWU under this Agreement shall conform to specifications, drawings, samples, or other descriptions contained or referenced herein and shall be merchantable, of good quality and workmanship and free from defect. The Contractor also warrants that all goods and services covered by this Agreement which are the product of the Contractor are in accordance with its specifications and consistent with industry standards. For software and website services, Contractor warrants that it will (a) use commercially reasonable efforts commensurate with the severity of any malfunction, defect, error or non-conformity in the services to correct the issue; (b) maintain reasonable safeguards and controls designed to deter and designed for the detection, prevention and correction of any unauthorized intrusion, access or use of the software and/or website including without limitation Trojan, ransomware and copy protect mechanisms; (c) notify TWU of any successful unauthorized intrusion, access or use of the software and/or website which may have resulted in access to TWU’s information, or TWU users’ information, as soon as reasonably practicable; and (d) while the software and/or website used in the provision of services to TWU may continue to improve and change over time, such changes shall not materially adversely affect the functioning of the software. Neither receipt of goods or services nor payment therefore shall constitute a waiver of this provision.\\n12.\\tAccess by Individuals with Disabilities. As required by 1 TAC Chapter 213 and 1 TAC Section 206.70 (as authorized by Subchapter M, Chapter 2054, Texas Government Code, the “EIR Code”), Contractor represents and warrants (the “EIR Accessibility Warranty”) that any electronic and information resources and all associated information, documentation, and support that it provides to TWU under this Agreement (collectively, the “EIRs”) comply with the applicable requirements set forth in the EIR Code. To the extent Contractor becomes aware that the EIRs, or any portion thereof, do not comply with the EIR Accessibility Warranty, then Contractor represents that it will, at no cost to TWU, either (1) perform all necessary remediation to make the EIRs satisfy the EIR Accessibility Warranty or (2) replace the EIRs with new EIRs that satisfy the EIR Accessibility Warranty. In the event that Contractor fails or is unable to do so, then TWU may terminate this Agreement and Contractor will refund to TWU all amounts TWU has paid under this Agreement within thirty (30) days after the termination date. \\n13.\\tSubcontracting. In the event Contractor subcontracts for any of the performances herein, Contractor will require such subcontractors to comply with the provisions of this Agreement related to Section (B)(2) (Use of Name, Logos, Etc., in Advertising & Publicity), Section (B)(14) (Confidentiality and Safeguarding University Records), Section (B)(15) (FERPA), and Subsection (B)(17) (Non-Discrimination) of this Agreement. The parties agree that TWU shall not be liable to Contractor for any payments to such subcontractor or its employees or agents and that TWU shall not be directly liable in any manner to Contractor’s subcontractor(s). Contractor agrees to comply with all state and federal laws applicable to any of its subcontracting, including, but not limited to, laws regarding wages, taxes, insurance, historically underutilized businesses and workers’ compensation. In no event shall this section or any other provision of this Agreement be construed as relieving Contractor of the responsibility for ensuring that all performances rendered under this Agreement, and any subcontracts thereto, are rendered in compliance with all of the terms of this Agreement.\\n14.\\tConfidentiality and Safeguarding University Records. Under this Agreement, Contractor may (1)\\xa0create, (2) receive from or on behalf of University, or (3) have access to, records or record systems (collectively, “University Records”). Among other things, University Records may contain social security numbers, credit card numbers, or data protected or made confidential or sensitive by applicable federal, state and local, laws, regulations, and ordinances, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Public Law No: 106-102) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. §1232g (“FERPA”). If University Records are subject to FERPA, (1) University designates Contractor as a University official with a legitimate educational interest in University Records, and (2) Contractor acknowledges that its improper disclosure or redisclosure of personally identifiable information from University Records will result in Contractor’s exclusion from eligibility to contract with University for at least five (5) years. Contractor represents, warrants, and agrees that it will: (1) hold University Records in strict confidence and will not use or disclose University Records except as (a) permitted or required by this Agreement, (b) required by law, or (c) otherwise authorized by University in writing; (2) safeguard University Records according to commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical standards (such as standards established by (i) the National Institute of Standards and Technology and (ii) the Center for Internet Security, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) that are no less rigorous than best practices in the data security industry; (3) continually monitor its operations and take any action necessary to assure that University Records are safeguarded and the confidentiality of University Records is maintained in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local, laws, regulations, and ordinances, including FERPA and the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, and the terms of this Agreement; and (4) comply with the University’s rules, policies, and procedures regarding access to and use of University’s computer systems. At the request of University, Contractor agrees to provide University with a written summary of the procedures Contractor uses to safeguard and maintain the confidentiality of University Records. Additional mandatory confidentiality and security compliance requirements with respect to University Records subject to FERPA are addressed below, where applicable.\\nNotice of Impermissible Use. If an impermissible use or disclosure of any University Records occurs, Contractor will provide written notice to University within one (1) business day after Contractor’s discovery of that use or disclosure. Contractor will promptly provide University with all information requested by University regarding the impermissible use or disclosure. \\nReturn of University Records. Contractor agrees that within thirty (30) days after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, for any reason, all University Records created or received from or on behalf of University will be (1) returned to University, with no copies retained by Contractor; or (2) if return is not feasible, destroyed. Twenty (20) days before destruction of any University Records, Contractor will provide University with written notice of Contractor’s intent to destroy University Records. Within five (5) days after destruction, Contractor will confirm to University in writing the destruction of University Records.\\nDisclosure. If Contractor discloses any University Records to a permitted subcontractor or agent, Contractor will require the permitted subcontractor or agent to comply with the same restrictions and obligations as are imposed on Contractor by this Section.    \\n15.\\tFERPA. For purposes of the Agreement and pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. §1232g; 34 CFR Part 99), TWU hereby designates Contractor as a school official with a legitimate educational interest in any educational records covered by the Agreement, only to the extent that access to the records are required by Contractor to carry out the purposes of the Agreement. Contractor agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the educational records in accordance with the provisions of FERPA. \\nConfidential Student Information. “Confidential Student Information” is defined as information that is personally identifiable to a student who is or was enrolled at University by any of the following means: the student’s name, the name of the student’s parent or other family members; the address of the student or student’s family; a personal identifier, such as a identification number, or biometric record; other indirect identifiers, including but not limited to the student’s date of birth, place of birth, and mother’s maiden name; or any other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community to identify the student with reasonable certainty and includes information supplied to Contractor by University as well as any information provided by University’s students and third parties to the Contractor.\\nContractor acknowledges that this Agreement may allow the Contractor access to Confidential Student Information, and that access to and disclosure of Confidential Student Information is restricted by University policy and FERPA.\\nIn the event that Contractor receives Confidential Student Information in the performance of this Agreement, Contractor agrees to hold Confidential Student Information in strict confidence. Contractor will not use or disclose Confidential Student Information received from or on behalf of University (or its students) except as permitted or required by this Agreement, as required by law, or as otherwise authorized in writing by University. Contractor agrees not to use Confidential Student Information for any purpose other than the purpose for which the disclosure was made. Contractor agrees that only Contractor’s employees who have a legitimate business need in performing this Agreement will have access to the Confidential Student Information.\\nUpon termination, cancellation, expiration or other conclusion of the Agreement, Contractor will follow the provisions of the Return of University Records section above with regard to University Records protected by FERPA.\\nContractor will develop, implement, maintain and use appropriate administrative, technical and physical security measures to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronically maintained or transmitted Confidential Student Information received from, or on behalf of University or its students. These measures will be extended by contract to all subcontractors used by Contractor.  \\nContractor agrees that Contractor is under the direct control of University with respect to the use and maintenance of Confidential Student Information. If University reasonably determines in good faith that Contractor has materially breached any of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or has violated FERPA, University, in its sole discretion, will have the right to require Contractor to submit to a plan of monitoring and reporting; provide Contractor with a fifteen (15) day period to cure the breach; or terminate the Agreement immediately.  Before exercising any of these options, University will provide written notice to Contractor describing the violation and the action it intends to take. If the Family Policy Compliance Office of the U.S. Department of Education determines that the Contractor improperly disclosed personally identifiable information obtained from University’s education records, University may not allow the Contractor access to education records for at least five years. \\nContractor will, within one day of discovery, report to University any use or disclosure of Confidential Student Information not authorized by this Agreement or in writing by University. Contractor’s report will identify: (i) the nature of the unauthorized use or disclosure, (ii) the Confidential Student Information used or disclosed, (iii) who made the unauthorized use or received the unauthorized disclosure, (iv) what Contractor has done or will do to mitigate any deleterious effect of the unauthorized use or disclosure, and (v) what corrective action Contractor has taken or will take to prevent future similar unauthorized use or disclosure. Contractor will provide such other information, including a written report, as reasonably requested by University. \\nContractor will indemnify, defend and hold University harmless from all claims, liabilities, damages, or judgments involving a third party, including University’s costs and attorney fees, which arise as a result of Contractor’s failure to meet or breach any of its obligations under this Agreement.\\n\\t\\tThe restrictions and obligations under this Section will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason. \\n16.\\tPublic Information. TWU strictly adheres to all statutes, court decisions and the opinions of the Texas Attorney General with respect to disclosure of public information under the Texas Public Information Act (“TPIA”), Chapter 552, Texas Government Code. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to prohibit disclosure of any information arising under the Agreement, including the Agreement itself, to the extent that such disclosure is required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority.\\nContractor acknowledges that information created or exchanged between the parties during the performance of this Agreement may be subject to the TPIA, and may be subject to required disclosure in a publicly accessible format. Contractor agrees that it will exercise professional judgment and care when creating documents or other media intended to be confidential that may be subject disclosure under the TPIA and Contractor will mark documents or media it considers to be confidential as “confidential”. However Contractor understands that such marking is merely Contractor’s assertion of the information as confidential, that such marking is not binding on TWU, and that the parties must still comply with the TPIA requirements should the marked documents not be determined to meet the confidentiality standards under the TPIA or pursuant to decision or opinion by the any applicable court, other governmental authority, or the Texas Attorney General.\\nContractor further acknowledges that “contracting information” is deemed to be public under the TPIA and TWU may not keep contracting information confidential as defined by TPIA § 552.0222.\\nDelete the remainder of this section if the total amount paid under this Contract is not $100,000 or more.\\nIf the total amount paid to Contractor under this Contract by TWU equals one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) or more, the Contractor must comply with applicable sections of the TPIA Section 552.371 in the performance of this Agreement, which requires Contractor to:\\n(1) preserve all contracting information related to the Agreement as provided by the records retention requirements applicable to TWU for the duration of the Agreement;\\n(2) promptly provide to TWU any contracting information related to the Agreement that is in the custody or possession of the Contractor on request of TWU; and\\n(3) on completion of the Agreement, either:\\n(A) provide at no cost to TWU all contracting information related to the Agreement that is in the custody or possession of the Contractor; or\\n(B) preserve the contracting information related to the Agreement as provided by the records retention requirements applicable to TWU.\\nAs required by the TPIA, Contractor hereby acknowledges the following:\\n“The requirements of Subchapter J, Chapter 552, Government Code, may apply to this contract and the contractor or Contractor agrees that the contract can be terminated if the contractor or Contractor knowingly or intentionally fails to comply with a requirement of that subchapter.”\\nFurther, in addition to the possible termination of the Agreement, Contractor acknowledges that failure to comply with the requirements of the TPIA may negatively affect Contractor’s eligibility to bid on future contracts with TWU.\\nThe definition of “contracting information” above is provided in Section 552.003(7) of the Government Code.\\n17.\\tNon-Discrimination. The parties agree to comply with applicable state and federal rules governing non-discrimination, equal opportunity and affirmative action.\\n18.\\tProhibited Bids and Contracts.

Contractor certifies that neither it nor its principals are presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, neither are in the process of being declared ineligible or being debarred, nor is either Contractor or any of its principals voluntarily excluded from covered transactions by any federal department or agency. TWU may immediately terminate this Agreement without penalty if Contractor’s certification herein is inaccurate or becomes inaccurate.\\n20.\\tNo Financial Interest. Contractor warrants, represents, and covenants that, in performing this Agreement, it will use reasonable care to ensure it does not employ any person who has direct or indirect financial interest in the transaction that is subject of this Agreement.\\n21.\\tHB 1295 Certification. TWU must comply with the “Disclosure of Interested Parties” requirements mandated by HB 1295, as implemented by the Texas Ethics Commission. The law states that a governmental entity or state agency may not enter into certain contracts with a business entity unless the business entity “submits a disclosure of interested parties to the governmental entity or state agency at the time the business entity submits the signed contract to the governmental entity or state agency.” The law applies to a contract of a governmental entity or state agency that has a value of at least $1 million. The Contractor therefore certifies that if required by Tex. Gov’t Code § 2252.908(d) it will submit the required disclosure of interested parties to TWU. Failure to do so will be grounds for termination of this Agreement without penalty to TWU.\\n22.\\tState Auditor’s Office.

Contractor shall, at all times during the term of the Agreement and for a period of four years after the completion of the services thereunder maintain such records, together with such supporting or underlying documents and materials. Contractor shall upon reasonable notice of TWU, whether during or after completion of the services and at TWU’s own expense make such records available for inspection and audit. Such records shall be made available to TWU during normal business hours at the TWU’s office or place of business. Costs of any audits conducted under the authority of this right to audit will be borne by TWU unless certain exemption criteria are met as stated hereafter. If the audit identifies inaccuracies (of any nature) by Contractor to TWU in excess of one‐half of one percent (.5%) of the total contract billings, the Contractor shall reimburse TWU the total costs of the audit. Any adjustments and/or payments that must be made as a result of any such audit or inspection of the Contractor’s records shall be made within a reasonable amount of time (not to exceed 90 days) from presentation of TWU’s findings to Contractor.\\n25.\\tPayment of Debt or Delinquency to the State. Pursuant to Sections 2107.008 and 2252.903, Texas Government Code, Contractor agrees that any payments owing to Contractor under the Agreement may be applied directly toward any debt or delinquency that Contractor owes the State of Texas or any agency of the State of Texas regardless of when it arises, until such debt or delinquency is paid in full.\\n26.\\tTax Certification. If Contractor is a taxable entity as defined by Chapter 171, Texas Tax Code (“Chapter 171”), then Contractor certifies that it is not currently delinquent in the payment of any taxes due under Chapter 171, or that Contractor is exempt from the payment of those taxes, or that Contractor is an out-of-state taxable entity that is not subject to those taxes, whichever is applicable. Contractor acknowledges that this Agreement may be terminated and payment may be withheld if this certification is or becomes inaccurate.\\n27.\\tTexas Family Code Child Support Certification. As required by Section 231.006, Texas Family Code, Contractor certifies that it is not ineligible to receive payments under the Agreement and acknowledges that the Agreement may be terminated and payment may be withheld if this certification is or becomes inaccurate.\\n28.\\tBuy Texas Certification. As required by Section 2155.4441 Texas Government Code, Contractor agrees that it will buy Texas products and materials for use in providing the services contemplated herein when such products and materials are available at a comparable price and within a comparable period of time when compared to non-Texas products and materials.\\n29.\\tBoycott Certification. As required by Texas Government Code Chapter 2271.002, Contractor certifies that either (1) it meets an exemption criteria under Section 2271.002; or (2) it does not boycott Israel and will not boycott Israel during the term of the Agreement. Contractor acknowledges this Agreement may be terminated and payment withheld if this certification is or becomes inaccurate. If Contractor meets an exemption, it shall provide TWU written notice of what that exemption is at the time the Agreement is made.\\nAs required by Texas Government Code Chapter 2274, if Contractor has 10 or more full-time employees and the Contractor is to receive $100,000 or more in value for goods and services provided to TWU under this Agreement, Contractor certifies that it does not boycott energy companies and will not boycott energy companies during the term of this Agreement. Contractor acknowledges this Agreement may be terminated and payment withheld if this certification is or becomes inaccurate.\\n30.\\tHealth and Safety Code Certification. Contractor will comply with Subchapter A, Chapter 161, Health and Safety Code 161.0085(c) which prohibits requiring a customer to provide any documentation certifying the customer ’s COVID-19 vaccination or post-transmission recovery on entry to, to gain access to, or to receive service from the business.\\n31.\\tAnti-Terrorism Certification.

Excepted from this prohibition are companies the United States government affirmatively declares to be excluded from its federal sanctions regime relating to Sudan, Iran or foreign terrorist organizations.\\n32.\\tGeneral Appropriations Act Certification. As required by article IX, Section 6.25 of the General Appropriations Act, and except as provided therein, Contractor acknowledges and agrees that funds may not be distributed under this Agreement to any individual or entity that: (1) Performs an abortion procedure that is not reimbursable under the state\\'s Medicaid program; (2) Is commonly owned, managed, or controlled by an entity that performs an abortion procedure that is not reimbursable under the states\\' Medicaid program; or (3) Is a franchise or affiliate of an entity that performs an abortion procedure that is not reimbursable under the state\\'s Medicaid program.\\n33.\\tFirearm Certification. As required by Subtitle F (State and Local Contracts and Fund Management), Title 10, Texas Government Code, if the total amount paid to Contractor under this Contract by TWU equals one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) or more, Contractor represents and warrants that it (a) does not have a practice, policy, guidance, or directive that discriminates against a firearm entity or firearm trade association; and (b) will not discriminate during the term of the contract against a firearm entity or firearm trade association.\\n34.\\tContractor Organization and Authority. If Contractor is a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, Contractor warrants, represents, covenants, and agrees that it is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation or organization and is duly authorized and in good standing to conduct business in the State of Texas, that it has all necessary power and has received all necessary approvals to execute and deliver this Agreement, and the individual executing this Agreement on behalf of Contractor has been duly authorized to act for and bind Contractor.\\n35.\\tForce Majeure.

Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.\\n37.\\tNon-Waiver. No covenant or condition of the Agreement may be waived except by written consent of the waiving party. Forbearance or indulgence by one party in any regard whatsoever shall not constitute a waiver of any other covenant or condition to be performed by the other party under this Agreement. \\n38.\\tSeverability/Interpretation. The fact that a particular provision in this Agreement is held under any applicable law to be void or unenforceable in no way affects the validity of other provisions, and this Agreement will continue to be binding on the parties. Any provision that is held to be void or unenforceable will be interpreted by the parties or the courts to be replaced with language that is as close as possible to the intent of the original provision so as to effectuate the purpose of this Agreement. Any ambiguous or conflicting terms shall be interpreted and construed in such a manner as to accomplish the purpose of this Agreement.\\n39.\\tAssignment.
