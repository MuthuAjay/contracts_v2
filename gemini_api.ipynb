For all purposes in this Agreement, Contractor hereby acknowledges that it is an independent contractor, and is not a state employee, partner, joint venture, or agent of TWU, and all persons employed to furnish services hereunder are employees of Contractor and not of TWU. As an independent contractor, Contractor will be solely responsible for determining the means and methods of performing the services described, in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. All individuals performing services hereunder will be employees of Contractor and Contractor will pay for all wages, expenses, federal and state payroll taxes and any similar tax relating to such employees. Contractor shall observe and abide by, and cause its employees and agents to abide by, all applicable laws, regulations, policies and procedures, including without limitation those of TWU relative to conduct on its premises.\\n2.\\tUse of Name, Logos, Etc., in Advertising & Publicity. Contractor agrees not to make reference to this Agreement or use the logo of TWU in any advertising material of any kind without the expressed written permission of TWU.

Contractor agrees to maintain, at Contractor’s sole expense, and provide proof of insurance meeting TWU’s Third Party Insurance Standards (www.twu.edu/media/documents/risk-management/TWU-Third-Party-Insurance-Standards.pdf). By requiring such minimum insurance, TWU shall not be deemed or construed to have assessed the risk that may be applicable to the Contractor.  Therefore, the Contractor shall assess its own risks and, if it deems appropriate, maintain higher limits and/or broader coverages. The Contractor is not relieved of any liability or obligations assumed or pursuant to the contract by reason of its failure to obtain or maintain insurance in sufficient amounts, duration, or types. The Contractor’s failure to comply with the requirements of this section shall be considered a breach of this Agreement. Proof of insurance coverage is to be forwarded to TWU Risk Management by email at risk@twu.edu.\\t \\nThe Contractor’s failure to comply with the requirements of this section shall be considered a breach of this Agreement.\\nProof of Insurance Coverage will be forwarded to: \\n\\tInsert University Contact Name (such as Department Contract Administrator) and complete address.\\n4.\\tUniversity Insurance. TWU is governed by the Texas Tort Claims Act, which sets forth certain limitations and restrictions on the types of liability and the types of insurance coverage that can be required of TWU. TWU represents to Contractor that it either has insurances policies in place or sufficient resources to self-insure for all claims for which it may be responsible under the Texas Tort Claims Act.  TWU further represents to Contractor that it either has workers’ compensation insurance in the amount required by Texas statute or is entitled to self-insure for workers compensation coverage under Texas law and has elected to do so. TWU does not provide insurance coverage or accept liability for the intentional or negligent acts or omissions of guests, invitees, and other persons not employed by TWU. \\n5.\\tSovereign Immunity. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a limitation or a waiver on any of the immunities or defenses to which TWU is entitled as an agency of the State of Texas.  TWU enters this Agreement only to the extent authorized by applicable law. Any provision of this Agreement that is not authorized by or is inconsistent with applicable Texas law, including the opinions of the state’s Attorney General, is invalid.\\n6.\\tContractor Indemnity. Contractor shall indemnify, defend and hold TWU, its Regents, officers, employees and agents harmless from any and all manner of suits, claims or demands (1) arising out of or relating to Contractor’s, its employees’, agents’ and subcontractors’ acts or omissions arising under the performance of this Agreement; (2) the negligence or willful misconduct of Contractor, its agents, employees or subcontractors; (3) Contractor’s breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation hereunder; and (4) the infringement of any third party proprietary rights with respect to goods or services supplied to TWU in connection with this Agreement (each of which is an “Indemnifying Act”). Contractor shall reimburse TWU for any and all costs, damages and expenses including reasonable attorney’s fees to which TWU may be subject as a result of the occurrence of any Indemnifying Act. This provision shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and the indemnities described in this paragraph will not be subject to any liability caps stated anywhere in the Agreement.\\n7.\\tTaxes. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to supersede the laws of the United States or the State of Texas that accord the State of Texas, Agency, and all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the State of Texas exemptions from the payment(s) of all taxes of whatever kind. More specifically, to the extent permitted by applicable law, TWU shall not directly or indirectly be liable for taxes of any kind. TWU shall provide all applicable tax exemption certificates upon Contractor’s request.\\n8.\\tInsolvency. In the event of any proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency by or against Contractor, or in the event of appointment (with or without Contractor’s consent) of an assignee for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver, TWU may terminate this Agreement without prior notice and without incurring any liability whatsoever to Contractor.\\n9.\\tSubject to Appropriation. The parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement will be interpreted to create a future obligation or liability in excess of the funds currently appropriated to the Agency.\\n10.\\tTexas Risk and Authorization Management (“TX-RAMP”) for Cloud-Based Software Services. The parties hereby agree that if under this Agreement Contractor provides a cloud-based software offering which meets the criteria specified under the TX-RAMP Program (the “Subject Cloud Software”), the Subject Cloud Software is required to be TX-RAMP certified (which can be satisfied by specific product TX-RAMP certification, STATE-RAMP, FED-RAMP certification or another certification process approved by the State of Texas). Contractor must therefore comply with TX-RAMP, which is a standardized approach for security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring of cloud computing services that processes the data of a Texas state agency. Texas Government Code § 2054.0593 mandates that TWU must only enter or renew contracts to receive cloud computing services that comply with TX-RAMP requirements beginning January 1, 2022. Contractor hereby warrants that the Subject Cloud Software has received, and Contractor will maintain, the approvals required by TX-RAMP. TWU may immediately terminate this Agreement without penalty if Contractor’s certification herein is inaccurate or becomes inaccurate. The parties agree that additional cloud-based services or products may not be added under this Agreement, unless such additional cloud-based services or products are also approved as required by TX-RAMP. For avoidance of doubt, if no Subject Cloud Software is being provided under this Agreement, this paragraph is not applicable.\\n11.\\tCompliance with Specifications. Contractor warrants that all goods, services, or work supplied to TWU under this Agreement shall conform to specifications, drawings, samples, or other descriptions contained or referenced herein and shall be merchantable, of good quality and workmanship and free from defect. The Contractor also warrants that all goods and services covered by this Agreement which are the product of the Contractor are in accordance with its specifications and consistent with industry standards. For software and website services, Contractor warrants that it will (a) use commercially reasonable efforts commensurate with the severity of any malfunction, defect, error or non-conformity in the services to correct the issue; (b) maintain reasonable safeguards and controls designed to deter and designed for the detection, prevention and correction of any unauthorized intrusion, access or use of the software and/or website including without limitation Trojan, ransomware and copy protect mechanisms; (c) notify TWU of any successful unauthorized intrusion, access or use of the software and/or website which may have resulted in access to TWU’s information, or TWU users’ information, as soon as reasonably practicable; and (d) while the software and/or website used in the provision of services to TWU may continue to improve and change over time, such changes shall not materially adversely affect the functioning of the software. Neither receipt of goods or services nor payment therefore shall constitute a waiver of this provision.\\n12.\\tAccess by Individuals with Disabilities. As required by 1 TAC Chapter 213 and 1 TAC Section 206.70 (as authorized by Subchapter M, Chapter 2054, Texas Government Code, the “EIR Code”), Contractor represents and warrants (the “EIR Accessibility Warranty”) that any electronic and information resources and all associated information, documentation, and support that it provides to TWU under this Agreement (collectively, the “EIRs”) comply with the applicable requirements set forth in the EIR Code. To the extent Contractor becomes aware that the EIRs, or any portion thereof, do not comply with the EIR Accessibility Warranty, then Contractor represents that it will, at no cost to TWU, either (1) perform all necessary remediation to make the EIRs satisfy the EIR Accessibility Warranty or (2) replace the EIRs with new EIRs that satisfy the EIR Accessibility Warranty. In the event that Contractor fails or is unable to do so, then TWU may terminate this Agreement and Contractor will refund to TWU all amounts TWU has paid under this Agreement within thirty (30) days after the termination date. \\n13.\\tSubcontracting. In the event Contractor subcontracts for any of the performances herein, Contractor will require such subcontractors to comply with the provisions of this Agreement related to Section (B)(2) (Use of Name, Logos, Etc., in Advertising & Publicity), Section (B)(14) (Confidentiality and Safeguarding University Records), Section (B)(15) (FERPA), and Subsection (B)(17) (Non-Discrimination) of this Agreement. The parties agree that TWU shall not be liable to Contractor for any payments to such subcontractor or its employees or agents and that TWU shall not be directly liable in any manner to Contractor’s subcontractor(s). Contractor agrees to comply with all state and federal laws applicable to any of its subcontracting, including, but not limited to, laws regarding wages, taxes, insurance, historically underutilized businesses and workers’ compensation. In no event shall this section or any other provision of this Agreement be construed as relieving Contractor of the responsibility for ensuring that all performances rendered under this Agreement, and any subcontracts thereto, are rendered in compliance with all of the terms of this Agreement.\\n14.\\tConfidentiality and Safeguarding University Records. Under this Agreement, Contractor may (1)\\xa0create, (2) receive from or on behalf of University, or (3) have access to, records or record systems (collectively, “University Records”). Among other things, University Records may contain social security numbers, credit card numbers, or data protected or made confidential or sensitive by applicable federal, state and local, laws, regulations, and ordinances, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Public Law No: 106-102) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. §1232g (“FERPA”). If University Records are subject to FERPA, (1) University designates Contractor as a University official with a legitimate educational interest in University Records, and (2) Contractor acknowledges that its improper disclosure or redisclosure of personally identifiable information from University Records will result in Contractor’s exclusion from eligibility to contract with University for at least five (5) years. Contractor represents, warrants, and agrees that it will: (1) hold University Records in strict confidence and will not use or disclose University Records except as (a) permitted or required by this Agreement, (b) required by law, or (c) otherwise authorized by University in writing; (2) safeguard University Records according to commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical standards (such as standards established by (i) the National Institute of Standards and Technology and (ii) the Center for Internet Security, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) that are no less rigorous than best practices in the data security industry; (3) continually monitor its operations and take any action necessary to assure that University Records are safeguarded and the confidentiality of University Records is maintained in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local, laws, regulations, and ordinances, including FERPA and the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, and the terms of this Agreement; and (4) comply with the University’s rules, policies, and procedures regarding access to and use of University’s computer systems. At the request of University, Contractor agrees to provide University with a written summary of the procedures Contractor uses to safeguard and maintain the confidentiality of University Records. Additional mandatory confidentiality and security compliance requirements with respect to University Records subject to FERPA are addressed below, where applicable.\\nNotice of Impermissible Use. If an impermissible use or disclosure of any University Records occurs, Contractor will provide written notice to University within one (1) business day after Contractor’s discovery of that use or disclosure. Contractor will promptly provide University with all information requested by University regarding the impermissible use or disclosure. \\nReturn of University Records. Contractor agrees that within thirty (30) days after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, for any reason, all University Records created or received from or on behalf of University will be (1) returned to University, with no copies retained by Contractor; or (2) if return is not feasible, destroyed. Twenty (20) days before destruction of any University Records, Contractor will provide University with written notice of Contractor’s intent to destroy University Records. Within five (5) days after destruction, Contractor will confirm to University in writing the destruction of University Records.\\nDisclosure. If Contractor discloses any University Records to a permitted subcontractor or agent, Contractor will require the permitted subcontractor or agent to comply with the same restrictions and obligations as are imposed on Contractor by this Section.    \\n15.\\tFERPA. For purposes of the Agreement and pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. §1232g; 34 CFR Part 99), TWU hereby designates Contractor as a school official with a legitimate educational interest in any educational records covered by the Agreement, only to the extent that access to the records are required by Contractor to carry out the purposes of the Agreement. Contractor agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the educational records in accordance with the provisions of FERPA. \\nConfidential Student Information. “Confidential Student Information” is defined as information that is personally identifiable to a student who is or was enrolled at University by any of the following means: the student’s name, the name of the student’s parent or other family members; the address of the student or student’s family; a personal identifier, such as a identification number, or biometric record; other indirect identifiers, including but not limited to the student’s date of birth, place of birth, and mother’s maiden name; or any other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community to identify the student with reasonable certainty and includes information supplied to Contractor by University as well as any information provided by University’s students and third parties to the Contractor.\\nContractor acknowledges that this Agreement may allow the Contractor access to Confidential Student Information, and that access to and disclosure of Confidential Student Information is restricted by University policy and FERPA.\\nIn the event that Contractor receives Confidential Student Information in the performance of this Agreement, Contractor agrees to hold Confidential Student Information in strict confidence. Contractor will not use or disclose Confidential Student Information received from or on behalf of University (or its students) except as permitted or required by this Agreement, as required by law, or as otherwise authorized in writing by University. Contractor agrees not to use Confidential Student Information for any purpose other than the purpose for which the disclosure was made. Contractor agrees that only Contractor’s employees who have a legitimate business need in performing this Agreement will have access to the Confidential Student Information.\\nUpon termination, cancellation, expiration or other conclusion of the Agreement, Contractor will follow the provisions of the Return of University Records section above with regard to University Records protected by FERPA.\\nContractor will develop, implement, maintain and use appropriate administrative, technical and physical security measures to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronically maintained or transmitted Confidential Student Information received from, or on behalf of University or its students. These measures will be extended by contract to all subcontractors used by Contractor.  \\nContractor agrees that Contractor is under the direct control of University with respect to the use and maintenance of Confidential Student Information. If University reasonably determines in good faith that Contractor has materially breached any of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or has violated FERPA, University, in its sole discretion, will have the right to require Contractor to submit to a plan of monitoring and reporting; provide Contractor with a fifteen (15) day period to cure the breach; or terminate the Agreement immediately.  Before exercising any of these options, University will provide written notice to Contractor describing the violation and the action it intends to take. If the Family Policy Compliance Office of the U.S. Department of Education determines that the Contractor improperly disclosed personally identifiable information obtained from University’s education records, University may not allow the Contractor access to education records for at least five years. \\nContractor will, within one day of discovery, report to University any use or disclosure of Confidential Student Information not authorized by this Agreement or in writing by University. Contractor’s report will identify: (i) the nature of the unauthorized use or disclosure, (ii) the Confidential Student Information used or disclosed, (iii) who made the unauthorized use or received the unauthorized disclosure, (iv) what Contractor has done or will do to mitigate any deleterious effect of the unauthorized use or disclosure, and (v) what corrective action Contractor has taken or will take to prevent future similar unauthorized use or disclosure. Contractor will provide such other information, including a written report, as reasonably requested by University. \\nContractor will indemnify, defend and hold University harmless from all claims, liabilities, damages, or judgments involving a third party, including University’s costs and attorney fees, which arise as a result of Contractor’s failure to meet or breach any of its obligations under this Agreement.\",\n",

TWU strictly adheres to all statutes, court decisions and the opinions of the Texas Attorney General with respect to disclosure of public information under the Texas Public Information Act (“TPIA”), Chapter 552, Texas Government Code. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to prohibit disclosure of any information arising under the Agreement, including the Agreement itself, to the extent that such disclosure is required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority.\\nContractor acknowledges that information created or exchanged between the parties during the performance of this Agreement may be subject to the TPIA, and may be subject to required disclosure in a publicly accessible format. Contractor agrees that it will exercise professional judgment and care when creating documents or other media intended to be confidential that may be subject disclosure under the TPIA and Contractor will mark documents or media it considers to be confidential as “confidential”. However Contractor understands that such marking is merely Contractor’s assertion of the information as confidential, that such marking is not binding on TWU, and that the parties must still comply with the TPIA requirements should the marked documents not be determined to meet the confidentiality standards under the TPIA or pursuant to decision or opinion by the any applicable court, other governmental authority, or the Texas Attorney General.\\nContractor further acknowledges that “contracting information” is deemed to be public under the TPIA and TWU may not keep contracting information confidential as defined by TPIA § 552.0222.\\nDelete the remainder of this section if the total amount paid under this Contract is not $100,000 or more.\\nIf the total amount paid to Contractor under this Contract by TWU equals one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) or more, the Contractor must comply with applicable sections of the TPIA Section 552.371 in the performance of this Agreement, which requires Contractor to:\\n(1) preserve all contracting information related to the Agreement as provided by the records retention requirements applicable to TWU for the duration of the Agreement;\\n(2) promptly provide to TWU any contracting information related to the Agreement that is in the custody or possession of the Contractor on request of TWU; and\\n(3) on completion of the Agreement, either:\\n(A) provide at no cost to TWU all contracting information related to the Agreement that is in the custody or possession of the Contractor; or\\n(B) preserve the contracting information related to the Agreement as provided by the records retention requirements applicable to TWU.\\nAs required by the TPIA, Contractor hereby acknowledges the following:\\n“The requirements of Subchapter J, Chapter 552, Government Code, may apply to this contract and the contractor or Contractor agrees that the contract can be terminated if the contractor or Contractor knowingly or intentionally fails to comply with a requirement of that subchapter.”\\nFurther, in addition to the possible termination of the Agreement, Contractor acknowledges that failure to comply with the requirements of the TPIA may negatively affect Contractor’s eligibility to bid on future contracts with TWU.\\nThe definition of “contracting information” above is provided in Section 552.003(7) of the Government Code.\\n17.\\tNon-Discrimination.

The law states that a governmental entity or state agency may not enter into certain contracts with a business entity unless the business entity “submits a disclosure of interested parties to the governmental entity or state agency at the time the business entity submits the signed contract to the governmental entity or state agency.” The law applies to a contract of a governmental entity or state agency that has a value of at least $1 million. The Contractor therefore certifies that if required by Tex. Gov’t Code § 2252.908(d) it will submit the required disclosure of interested parties to TWU. Failure to do so will be grounds for termination of this Agreement without penalty to TWU.\\n22.\\tState Auditor’s Office.

Pursuant to Sections 2107.008 and 2252.903, Texas Government Code, Contractor agrees that any payments owing to Contractor under the Agreement may be applied directly toward any debt or delinquency that Contractor owes the State of Texas or any agency of the State of Texas regardless of when it arises, until such debt or delinquency is paid in full.\\n26.\\tTax Certification.

Contractor acknowledges that this Agreement may be terminated and payment may be withheld if this certification is or becomes inaccurate.\\n27.\\tTexas Family Code Child Support Certification. As required by Section 231.006, Texas Family Code, Contractor certifies that it is not ineligible to receive payments under the Agreement and acknowledges that the Agreement may be terminated and payment may be withheld if this certification is or becomes inaccurate.\\n28.\\tBuy Texas Certification.

Contractor acknowledges this Agreement may be terminated and payment withheld if this certification is or becomes inaccurate.\\n30.\\tHealth and Safety Code Certification. Contractor will comply with Subchapter A, Chapter 161, Health and Safety Code 161.0085(c) which prohibits requiring a customer to provide any documentation certifying the customer ’s COVID-19 vaccination or post-transmission recovery on entry to, to gain access to, or to receive service from the business.\\n31.\\tAnti-Terrorism Certification.

As required by Subtitle F (State and Local Contracts and Fund Management), Title 10, Texas Government Code, if the total amount paid to Contractor under this Contract by TWU equals one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) or more, Contractor represents and warrants that it (a) does not have a practice, policy, guidance, or directive that discriminates against a firearm entity or firearm trade association; and (b) will not discriminate during the term of the contract against a firearm entity or firearm trade association.\\n34.\\tContractor Organization and Authority. If Contractor is a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, Contractor warrants, represents, covenants, and agrees that it is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation or organization and is duly authorized and in good standing to conduct business in the State of Texas, that it has all necessary power and has received all necessary approvals to execute and deliver this Agreement, and the individual executing this Agreement on behalf of Contractor has been duly authorized to act for and bind Contractor.\\n35.\\tForce Majeure.

Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.\\n37.\\tNon-Waiver. No covenant or condition of the Agreement may be waived except by written consent of the waiving party. Forbearance or indulgence by one party in any regard whatsoever shall not constitute a waiver of any other covenant or condition to be performed by the other party under this Agreement. \\n38.\\tSeverability/Interpretation. The fact that a particular provision in this Agreement is held under any applicable law to be void or unenforceable in no way affects the validity of other provisions, and this Agreement will continue to be binding on the parties. Any provision that is held to be void or unenforceable will be interpreted by the parties or the courts to be replaced with language that is as close as possible to the intent of the original provision so as to effectuate the purpose of this Agreement. Any ambiguous or conflicting terms shall be interpreted and construed in such a manner as to accomplish the purpose of this Agreement.\\n39.\\tAssignment.
